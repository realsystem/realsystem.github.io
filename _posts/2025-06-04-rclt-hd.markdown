## 🛠️ Full Step-by-Step Guide: RCLT HD Install on Tacoma

Here’s a breakdown of how to install the **RCLT HD** on a 3rd Gen Tacoma. You can complete this with basic mechanical knowledge and some patience.

---

### ✅ Step 1: Pre-Installation Prep

#### Flush the Power Steering System  
Old fluid can cause premature wear on your new MarRack. Flush and refill with clean power steering fluid.

#### Remove Factory Suspension & Steering  
Take off the following components:

- Upper & lower control arms  
- Knuckles, CV axles, tie rods  
- Rack and pinion  
- Factory sway bar (optional)

---

### ✅ Step 2: Prepare the HD Knuckles

You have two options here:

- **Using New Parts** – Install outer oil seals, press hubs, add O-rings, grease the knuckle, and torque the hub bolts to **44 lb-ft**.  
- **Reusing OEM Parts** – Carefully remove and clean hubs from factory knuckles, inspect and grease components, then install them into the new RCLT HD knuckles.

Finally, install the **inner oil seals** on both knuckles.

---

### ✅ Step 3: Assemble Upper Control Arms (UCAs)

1. **Install grease Zerks** – Torque to **30 in-lbs**  
2. **Grease and insert bushings**  
3. **Install compression sleeves** – Lightly tap them in with a mallet

UCAs feature thick ¼” bracing and are designed for max clearance and travel.

---

### ✅ Step 4: Assemble Lower Control Arms (LCAs)

1. **Install grease Zerks** – Same as UCAs  
2. **Grease and install oversized bushings**  
3. **Install frame-specific compression sleeves**:

   - *Type III frames*: Use thick wall `MCSU71521111`  
   - *Type IV frames*: Use thin wall `MCSU71521112`

LCAs are engineered for max durability, impact absorption, and increased approach angle.

---

### ✅ Step 5: Install the RCLT HD Components

#### Install Upper Control Arms

- Position with the uniball plate facing up and straight leg toward the rear.  
- Grease all bushing faces and torque the factory shock tower bolt to **64 lb-ft**.

#### Grease the Zerks

Use a 90° grease gun and water-resistant grease on all UCA and LCA fittings.

#### Brake Compatibility Note

Tacomas **before 2015** require drilling caliper holes to 9/16” to fit M14 bolts (Toyota part `90105-14198`).  
Alternatively, upgrade to **2015+ 4Runner/GX460 calipers and rotors** for an OEM big brake setup.

---

## 🧪 Final Steps & Inspection

- Double-check **torque specs** on all bolts  
- Fully grease all control arm bushings  
- Align your front suspension  
- Bleed the power steering system if the rack was replaced  
- Test drive and re-check hardware after 50–100 miles
